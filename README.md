# Trigger Word Detection with Deep Learning 🎙️🔍

This repository contains my implementation of the **Trigger Word Detection** programming assignment from the **DeepLearning.AI Deep Learning Specialization**. The project builds and trains a deep learning model to detect a specific trigger word in real-time audio streams.

## 📘 Project Overview

The objective is to create a system that listens to audio and detects when the trigger word—here, **"activate"**—is spoken. This technology underpins virtual assistants like Alexa, Google Home, and Siri.

The model takes a 10-second audio clip as input and outputs a probability sequence indicating when the trigger word has likely been spoken. A threshold crossing triggers an alert (e.g., a chime sound).

## 🧠 Key Concepts and Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Synthesis  
Due to the scarcity of labeled speech data, training data is programmatically generated by overlaying trigger word clips and negative examples onto background noise clips, with corresponding labels marking trigger word occurrences.

### 2. Audio Preprocessing  
Audio clips are converted into **spectrograms**—visual frequency representations over time—which serve as inputs to the model instead of raw waveforms.

### 3. Model Architecture  
- **Conv1D Layer:** Acts as a feature extractor, reducing input sequence length.  
- **Two GRU Layers:** Capture temporal dependencies across the sequence.  
- **TimeDistributed Dense Layer:** Outputs probability per time step with sigmoid activation.

This unidirectional RNN architecture efficiently models sequential audio data to detect trigger words.
